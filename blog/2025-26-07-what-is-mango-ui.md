Hello there, curious wanderer! 👋  
You’ve stumbled across Mango UI — a little project that sprouted from a wild idea:  
*What if desktop apps could be written in a clean, declarative DSL instead of wrestling with boilerplate?* 🍋

It all started with a dream of making a programming language.  
But on the journey, we noticed something odd:  
there weren’t many DSLs out there for desktop app development.  
So, fueled by the declarative spirit (and maybe too much coffee ☕), Mango UI was born.

### A Taste of Mango
Here’s a tiny “Hello World” in Mango UI — short, sweet, and to the point:

```mango
window "Hello, Mango!"
```

No extra wiring, no complex boilerplate — just the essentials.
(And yes, it really does pop up a window!)

### Why F#?
Mango UI is built on top of F#.
Why? Because F# is a natural fit for DSLs:
- It's pattern matching makes parsing elegant
- It's concise syntax keeps the host code readable
- It's functional style meshes perfectly with declarative thinking

We wanted a host language that doesn’t get in the way — and F# gives us just that.

### Our Roadmap
Mango UI is still young — but like a mango tree, we’ve got growth planned 🌱:

#### Phase 1: Roots
- Basic interpretation engine
- Core UI elements (via Avalonia)

#### Phase 2: Branches
- Declarative event handling
- Function & variable declarations
- Expanded UI component set

#### Phase 3: Leaves
- Performance tuning & layout improvements
- Experimenting with a lower-level rendering backend

#### Possible Future Fruits 🍊
- Compiling to WebAssembly or standalone .exe apps
- Direct rendering using OpenGL, Vulkan, or DirectX
- Cross-platform desktop distribution with minimal dependencies

### Why Mango UI?
Because building desktop apps should feel fresh, expressive, and maybe even… fun! 🍹Mango UI is still growing, but we hope you’ll enjoy watching (and helping) it bloom.
