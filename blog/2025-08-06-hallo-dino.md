Hi there, traveller! As you can see, it's pretty empty here... so while you're around, help yourself to some popcorn: 🍿🍿🍿

After such a long journey, you must be exhausted. Here, take a seat: 💺💺💺💺💺💺💺💺💺💺  
(Not enough for everyone though — first come, first served!)

How did we end up here? Well, at some point, we figured it was time to make a documentation site for our beloved Mango language.

How many mangos have *you* eaten today?
